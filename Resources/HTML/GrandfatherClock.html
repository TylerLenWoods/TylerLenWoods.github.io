	<p class="text-justify m-1">I had the privelege of illustrating for a local band called Farewell Friend. They began their journey back in 2012 led by Tom Troyer, the singer, songwriter and acoustic guitarist. Tom was actually one of the first people I met when I moved to Greensboro, NC. Our friendship led to this beautifully unique collaboration of music and art. </p>

			<h3>Sketch</h3>
			<p><small>The first part of any project starts with simple thumbnail sketches. Tom Troyer, of Farewell Friend, had the idea of an old ship at sea. Before going into much detail, I wanted to cast out a few concepts out to know exactly what he had in mind. The angle of the ship as well as the placement were the most important pieces to resolve first.<br><br>It's always a good idea to establish the vision as much as possible early on before wasting too much time on the details. I've learned this the hard way.<br><br>First I grabbed a pencil. Then I sketched out really small concepts. Again, the idea here is to get a basic idea of the layout of the landscape and the ship's angle.<br><br>Tom and I both agreed that we liked the first one better. In my opinion, the first one is more interesting. The ship is coming at you. The angle is visually more pleasing.</small></p>

		<div class="col-md-6 p-3">
			<h3>Drafts</h3>
			<p><small>Once we picked the sketch, I made several drafts of the same image using micron pen and thick sketching paper. Each draft was slightly different.<br><br> One detail that really stood out from the others was the small island in the background of the far right draft. It is much smaller and provides a greater depth to the overall landscape. The water also looks more realistic in the last draft.</small></p>

		<div class="col-md-6 p-3">
			<h3>Final</h3>
			<p><small>With these two details, it was apparent which version we would choose. The final illustration had enough detail, depth, and realism to move forward. There was also the included anchor drop that Tom requested.<br><br>The process from sketch to final took around 6 hours. It was well worth it. Tom was excited and impressed. I'm not gonna lie, I felt pretty good about my work too!<br><br>This project allowed me to work on my pen work. Precision was key. Ocean texture was an experiment that became better each draft. Drawing the same image multiple times with every revision helped me become a more disciplined illustrator.</small></p>

			<h3>Digital</h3>
			<p><small>As much as I'd love to take credit for turning my illustration into a digital piece, I simply can not. Tom's wife, Joy Troyer, took my illustration to the next level by using Photoshop. An interior designer herself, she has helped Tom with several of the visual designs for Farewell Friend.<br><br>To be completely transparent, this was one the first paid projects I ever had as an illustrator. I've always loved to draw. Yet, I had never had the thought, "I could get paid for that".<br><br>At the time I did not even have Photoshop, or even know how to digitize my illustrations. Tom had seen some of my drawings at my house and asked if I would be interested in drawing his E.P. cover. From there it's history.<br><br>Also, I have Photoshop now. And it's awesome.</small></p>
