	<p class="text-justify m-1">Farewell Friend invited me back a second time to create their album artwork. Once again I was honored to help them tell their story better by creating a visual branding for their second album entitled <em>Glenwood And Gomorrah</em>. Their singer-songwriter, Tom Troyer, said, <em>"it's an EP of songs Iâ€™ve written about my time and the community I experienced in my old neighborhood"</em>, and the songs portray it beautifully.</p>

			<h3>Sketch</h3>
			<p><small>At first Tom gave me a simple concept with plenty of creative space to work with. He knew that he wanted the artwork to be abstract from the beginning. He wanted simple shapes and strokes that formed a house with a dancing girl in front.<br><br>I referenced a few google images of women dancing and I liked this movement and form. I lightly sketched the reference and then turned her into a composite of geometrical shapes. The house behind her is more ambiguous. Honestly, without knowing what it is supposed to be I wouldn't expect anyone to guess it was a house.<br><br>There were elements of it that Tom liked. He liked the simplicity of it. He saw it and knew that he wanted the artwork to be black and white. This was a good spring board. The next step was to make some revisions.</small></p>

			<h3>Drafts</h3>
			<p><small>Tom had really good ideas as well as great ways to get me there. He wanted to focus on brush strokes rather than geometrical shapes. He wanted the house to be less subtle and more suggestive. He also wanted the girl to be a bit more dramatic.<br><br>I found a new reference for a girl dancing. This time I chose a girl in mid-air, the arms and legs stretched out, reaching, expressing complete freedom and control. At least that's how I interpret it. The house behind her is grey to give the objects more of a contrast. It can easily be seen as a house now as well.<br><br>Tom loved the shape and stroke of the dancing girl but wanted me to play around a bit with the structure of the house. I sent him four different examples to see if any one of them felt right. Still unsure of the house, we decided to meet up to make changes together in person. It worked in our favor.</small></p>

		<div class="col-md-6 p-3">
			<h3>Final &amp; Print</h3>
			<p><small>The final design was simplified even more. Less detail in the house meant less distraction from the dancing girl. We leaned into the minimalistic theme and it paid off.<br><br>His wife, Joy Troyer, put together the final print version and added the typography for the sleeve.

			<h3>GIF Animation</h3>
			<p class="text-center"><small><br>
				I was also able to create some GIFs for the promotion of Glenwood And Gomorrah. I animated the dancing girl and each of the band members. I used the program RoughAnimator on the iPad. </small></p>
